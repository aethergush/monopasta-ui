                         ———  A weird and cool UI for a website (and for MY upcoming website). ———

Welcome, I guess. You're here, so...

Monopasta (hello the weird name!) is a more or less simple user interface for the web. It includes, built-in, a few cool stuff:

  • A nice default and responsive page, with a really cool menu and a hamburger icon animation (so it maaaaagically transforms into an 'x' shape);
  • Cool colors which you can (and hopefully will) change; and ...
  • Other random built-in stuff like a completely different and weird table.
